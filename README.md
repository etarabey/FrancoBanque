This program permits the user into creating a bank account by creating a username and password. These credentials could then be used again by the user to login to their
account, even when they close the program. Once logged in, you could deposit money into your account, withdraw it, calculate interest, change your password, delete your account, 
add more cards to your account and logoff. 

The essence of this program relies on using two Python files, one is the code for the main screen, and the other runs the operations that the user desires. The program is
able to remember the login info of the user because I have based my database on the use of files to store their information, including: username, password and how much money they
stored in their accounts. 

NOTE: This program's UI is written in French, as well as the comments because this was a graded assignment for my coding class, and that was taken in French.
